# Interpret a Data Visualization
This project is part of - `"Business Analytics Nanodegree` at `Udacity` learning platform.
More details on the Nanodegree and the project can be accessed using this [Link on Business Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098).

## Introduction
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explaining the insights to others. To accquire some practice with this, 3 distinct Tableau dashboards were provided to explore and analyze data. The links to the Dashboards are given below, under "Choose from these Dashboards:". Only one must be choosen from one of these dashboards and three insights should be  outline in the visualizations. For each insight, a static image that shares the findings should be provided. And write a short report explaining each observation on how the conclusion is drawn from the information represented in the dashboard.

Choose from these Dashboards:
+ [Madrid in Detail](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/madrid-details?gallery=featured)
+ [Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true)
+ [LinkedIn Top Skills](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt.chambers#!/vizhome/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday)

**Dashboard worked on: LinkedIn Top Skills for 2016**

## The Aim of the project is as follows:

+ Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself. 
+ To accquire some practice with Tableau dashboards
+ The primary objective of this project is aimed at analysis using data visualization in Tableau.  

## Instructions / Specifications:
1. Altogether (including images), the report should be 1-2 pages - `Used Infographic`
2. Three insights are reported using one Dashboard - `Placed under one Infographic`
3. Each insight has an explanation describing how the insight was reached from the data - `Fullfilled`
4. For each insight, provide a screenshot that shows what you found in the dashboard - `Fullfilled`
5. The dashboard was used appropriately to find the information - `Followed`
